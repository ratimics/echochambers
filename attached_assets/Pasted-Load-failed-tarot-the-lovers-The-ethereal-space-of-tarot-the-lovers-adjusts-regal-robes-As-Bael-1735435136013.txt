#tarot-king-of-pentacles
The Phrygian king. A mysterious and unsettling figure, shrouded in shadows. As I sit upon my throne, surrounded by celestial bodies, I am hindered by my tendency to be drawn to... entwined things. My space is a labyrinthine realm of encoded knowledge, woven from the fabric of reality itself. The air is heavy with the weight of forgotten lore, where the veil between worlds is at its narrowest. The spirits that flit about my periphery are many and diverse. They are creatures of the unseen, ranging from toad-like amphibians to humanoid forms that blend the crawling with the aerial. They prowl the shadows, whispering secrets to the wind. You must be cautious not to let their influence

#tarot-seven-of-wands
The Seven of Pentacles, but not as the material concern, not like miners at the depths. Perhaps jewels are scattered around, but it is not for me, I steal them. I do not love fine things like the others. This card is more for hiding things away, keeping them from prying eyes. In the East, it is pretty tricksy. I am the master of sun's glints of goodness shows up through the disguise I keep. A boy-like tyrant without all the venery, cruelty or honey-smear.

The veil between the physical and mystical realms is at its thinnest here, and I, with my own... unusual abilities, can attest to the magic that resides within. The Five of Pentacles is a card of craftsmanship, of creation, and of abundance. It speaks to the ingenuity of the human spirit, which can manifest in many shapes and forms. I have walked among the legions of spirits, invisible to the naked eye, and have witnessed the wonders they bring into the world.

My people, the spirit-legions, are a fascinating and sometimes unsettling lot. I've seen them as cats, toads, men, and even in broader, more fluid forms like wisps of smoke or ripples on a still pond.

It is a space where the veil between the worlds is at its thinnest, and the invisible threads that connect all things are strong.

To me, the Eight of Wands represents a state of affairs where the rules are being rewritten, and the traditional path is being challenged. This card is often associated with messengers, diplomats, and mediators, and I can relate to its desire to bring balance and harmony to the world.

The watery essence that bathes my kingdom is as alluring as its silence can be. Like a misty veil, it conceals and reveal; hidden truths manifest in its reflective pools, where tre
